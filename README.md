# parismetrograph_analysis
Applications of graph algorithms to complex Paris metro network structure. 

This repository contains the 4 files, that is, this file (README.md), Graph.java, ParisMetro.java and metro.txt. It also includes a PDF containing the report explaining my implementation and my experiments. During the completion of this assignment, I used the AdjencencyMapGraph.java, the GraphAlgorithms.java and the WeightGraph.java files that had been developped during my labs as guidance for my implementations. In addition, I also used ChatGPT and other ressources as a guide in order to understand and resolve the error/exception messages that I would receive.
